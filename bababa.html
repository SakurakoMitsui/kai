                   <h1 style="font: size 100%;">The straw millionaire</h1>
                   <p>A long time ago, one young man prayed to Kannon, the goddess of Mercy at a temple.

                    “My god, please make me rich.”
                    
                    Then the Kannon appeared and said to him,
                    
                    “The thing you first catch after you leave here will make you rich.”
                    
                    The young man became happy to hear that, but he stumbled over a stone on leaving the temple.
                    
                    And at the instant, he grabbed one straw.
                    
                    “I wonder if this is the first thing I catch as the Kannon told me.
                    
                    I doubt I will be rich with this.”
                    
                    As he was tilting his head and wondering, a horsefly flew to him.
                    
                    He caught the horsefly and played tying it on the straw
                    
                    Then one fine oxcart came close to him and a kid inside the cart said to him,
                    
                    “I want that horsefly.”
                    
                    “Sure. Here you are.”
                    
                    As he gave the straw with a horsefly to the kid, the retainer gave him three oranges in return.
                    
                    “A straw became three oranges.”
                    
                    He began walking again, and he found a woman on the road suffering from thirst.
                    
                    “Here, take this oranges instead of water.”
                    
                    The woman recovered after she ate those oranges.
                    
                    She gave him a beautiful cloth in return.
                    
                    “This time, three oranges became a cloth.”
                    
                    As he was walking with the cloth, he found a man having a trouble over his sick horse.
                    
                    “What's the matter?”
                    
                    “My horse was down for his sickness.
                    
                    I was going to go to a town to exchange this horse for a cloth.
                    
                    I will be in trouble if I don't get a cloth today.”
                    
                    “Would you like to exchange this cloth for your horse?”
                    
                    When he suggested, the man took the cloth back with delight.
                    
                    After he took care of the horse watering and rubbing the body, the horse got well soon.
                    
                    Looking closely, it was a quite fine horse.
                    
                    “Now a cloth became a horse.”
                    
                    As he was walking with the horse, he found a house taking place a move.
                    
                    When the master of the house saw his fine horse, he said to him,
                    
                    “I have to go on a trip all of a sudden and I need a horse.
                    
                    Would you possibly exchange your horse for my house and field?”
                    
                    The young man received a nice house and a large field, and became rich after all.
                    
                    Because one straw made him a very rich man, people called him “the straw millionaire.”</p>
   

                    <h1 style="font: size 100%;">Mouse's marriage</h1>
                    <p>Once upon a time, there lived a young mouse, Chuuko, and her mother and father. 

                      One day, Chuuko's mother said to her father, ”Dear, isn't it about time that we find a nice husband for Chuuko?”
                      
                      ”So it is... But seeing as she's the best daughter in the world, she deserves only the best husband in the world. I suppose the strongest husband in the world would be the Sun...” 
                      
                      With that, Chuuko's mother and father went to the Sun and asked him, ”Oh, Sun, you who are the strongest in the whole world, will you accept our Chuuko as your bride?”
                      
                      ”I'm honored you asked me, but the Cloud is stronger than I. After all, he can cover me up easily..”
                      
                      And so Chuuko's mother and father made their way to the Cloud and asked, ”Oh Cloud, you who are the strongest in the whole world, will you accept our Chuuko as your bride?”
                      
                      The Cloud replied, ”I'm honored you asked me, but the Wind is stronger than I. After all, blowing me away is nothing to him...”
                      
                      And so Chuuko's mother and father made their way to the Wind and asked, ”Oh Wind, you who are the strongest in the world, will you accept our Chuuko as your bride?”
                      
                      The Wind replied, ”I'm honored you asked me, but the Wall is stronger than I. After all, no matter how hard I huff and puff, my breath merely glances off of him...” 
                      
                      And so Chuuko's mother and father made their way to the Wall and asked, ”Oh Wall, you who are the strongest in the world, will you accept our Chuuko as your bride?”
                      
                      The Wall replied, ”I'm honored you asked me, but there is another, stronger even than I. That would be you mice. After all, even I can be brought down by your constant gnawing at me.” 
                      
                      ”Do you mean to say... we mice are the strongest in the world?” asked Chuuko's father. 
                      
                      Upon hearing that, they chose a mouse to be Chuuko's husband, and they lived happily ever after.</p>
                      


                      <h1 style="font: size 100%;">One Inch Boy</h1>
                      <p>Long, long ago there lived an old man and his wife in a village. They had no children, so they had prayed and asked God for a baby every day.
                        "God, please give us a baby. Even if it is an inch baby, that's okay."
                        One day, to their surprise, they were blessed with a small baby, whose height was only one inch or so. They named him 'Issun-boshi', One-Inch Boy. They loved him so much and raised him like a treasure.
                        The boys in the neighborhood made fun of him. "Hey, Inch, Inch, Inch boy." The old mother got very angry with them. "What naughty boys you are!" But the inch boy grew up to be healthy and intelligent.
                        One day he said to his parents.
                        "My father and mother, please give me a needle, a straw, a wooden bowl and a chopstick."
                        "What are you going to do with them?" asked his mother.
                        "A needle is a sword. A straw is a scabbard. A wooden bowl is a boat. A chopstick is an oar. I'll go to the capital and become a brave warrior." answered he.
                        His parents gave him the permission at once. The next day he left home for the capital.
                        When he was walking, he met an ant.
                        "Dear Ant, where is a river?"
                        "It's near the dandelion fields."
                        There he found it flowing. The bowl, which he was in, went down the river like an arrow. Then a fish came to attack him. The fish mistook him for a delicious food. He protected himself with the chopstick. Swung by wave, caught in much rain, blown by heavy wind, he at last got to the capital after a long journey.
                        He walked along the busy street proudly. He found a big and gorgeous house. He thought of working there.
                        "Open the door. I want to ask a favor of you."
                        The master opened the door and looked around for him.
                        "Where are you? I can't see anybody.”
                        "I'm here at the foot of you."
                        The master found him near his 'getas', the Japanese wooden
                        clogs.
                        "I am called an One-Inch boy. I want to work for you here."
                        "You seem to be an active and clever boy. I'll make you one of my followers."
                        This rich man had a beautiful daughter, who treated him with affection and
                        taught him to write and read. He was so clever that he could master it soon.
                        One day she went to a shrine with him. On their way home they met a big ogre. The ogre was going to kidnap her to his house.
                        "Bad Ogre, if you touch her, I'll kill you." said the inch boy.
                        "What can you do against me, inch boy? I'll eat you." said the ogre and swallowed him down quickly.
                        "Ouch, ouch....."
                        One inch boy pierced him with the needle in his stomach.
                        "Ouch, I'll die. I'll give up. Help me."
                        The ogre vomited him out and ran away toward the mountain.
                        "Thank you very much for helping me. You are so small but very brave and strong."
                        "Look, the ogre left something. What is it?" asked he.
                        "It's called the 'uchide-no-kozuchi', the magic mallet. It's the
                        ogre's treasure. If we swing it, we can have anything we
                        want. Inch boy, what is your wish?" asked she.
                        "I'd like my height. Please make me a tall boy."
                        She swung it. One inch boy became taller and taller to be a
                        very tall and handsome man.
                        He married her and became a brave warrior in the capital of Kyoto as he had wished.</p>
